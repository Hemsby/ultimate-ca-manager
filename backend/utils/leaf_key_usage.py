"""Key-algorithm-aware KeyUsage for end-entity certificates (#327).

keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment describe RSA key transport: the
certified public key encrypts a symmetric key (or data) directly. No other
key type UCM issues for can do that. RFC 5480 §3 restricts an id-ecPublicKey
end-entity certificate to digitalSignature, nonRepudiation and keyAgreement
(encipherOnly/decipherOnly only under keyAgreement); RFC 8410 §5 restricts
Ed25519/Ed448 to the signature bits.

UCM's leaf profiles were written with RSA in mind and asserted
keyEncipherment on every server-class certificate whatever the key, so an
ECDSA leaf carried a bit it cannot honour unless a template with the bit
deselected was used, which an ACME order (no template to select) could not
do, and certificate linters flagged the result. Every leaf issuance path
(issue form, approval workflow, Sign CSR, ACME, EST, SCEP, WSTEP) now routes
its KeyUsage through this module, so the same key gets the same bits
whichever way it arrives, with no configuration needed.
