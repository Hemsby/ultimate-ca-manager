"""
HTTP Negotiate/SPNEGO (RFC 4559) authentication for MS-XCEP/MS-WSTEP's
Kerberos binding (``ADPolicyProvider_CEP_Kerberos`` /
``ADCertificateService_CES_Kerberos``).

Unlike the UsernamePassword and Certificate bindings — where credentials are
carried inside the SOAP body via WS-Security (``services/wstep/soap_envelope.py``,
``services/wstep/ws_security.py``) — Kerberos authentication for CEP/CES
happens at the HTTP transport layer, exactly like IIS Windows Integrated
Authentication or Apache ``mod_auth_gssapi``: an ``Authorization: Negotiate
<base64 SPNEGO token>`` header, verified against a keytab via GSSAPI.
Confirmed against a real-world writeup of Linux CES/CEP Kerberos enrollment
(``requests-kerberos`` client side, keytab-backed GSSAPI acceptor server
side) since, as with phases 1-2, the published MS-XCEP/MS-WSTEP spec text
doesn't spell out which binding is transport-level vs message-level.

Real SPNEGO negotiation is *not* always a single round trip, even for
Kerberos-only. Confirmed against the lab with a real domain admin ticket:
Windows' NegTokenInit listed its legacy MS-KRB5 OID ahead of the standard
KRB5 OID, which didn't match this acceptor's own preferred mech, so SPNEGO's
RFC 4178 anti-downgrade rule kicked in and the acceptor had to respond with
``negState: request-mic`` instead of completing outright -- a third leg
(client sends a mechListMIC, acceptor confirms) is mandatory in that case,
not an artifact of any configurable pyspnego option. So this module keeps
in-progress ``spnego`` contexts across requests, keyed by the client's source
IP (``REMOTE_ADDR`` -- gunicorn here runs a single worker, so an in-process
dict is safe). Confirmed against the lab that a real WCF client
(``MS-WebServices/1.0``, what GPMC's policy-server "Validate" and GPO
autoenrollment both use) opens a *new* TCP connection -- a new ``REMOTE_PORT``
every time -- for each leg of the handshake rather than reusing one, unlike
a browser or ``requests``/``curl``; keying on the full ``(REMOTE_ADDR,
REMOTE_PORT)`` tuple (as real NTLM connection-binding would require and as
this module's first version did) meant every leg missed its predecessor's
pending context and the handshake could never complete against that client.
IP-only keying tolerates that. Entries expire after a short TTL so an
abandoned handshake can't leak memory; the small residual risk -- two
distinct clients negotiating concurrently from behind the same source IP
(e.g. NAT) momentarily colliding on the same pending context -- fails
closed (the wrong context's crypto just won't verify, forcing a retry),
not open.

This module relies on the underlying krb5 library's own replay cache
(enabled by default in both MIT and Heimdal krb5, and not something this
code disables or configures) to reject a captured/replayed
AP-REQ -- gss_accept_sec_context() only ever sees a token once per
legitimate exchange, so there is no additional replay protection at this
layer, nor in _pending_contexts (which key on source IP for
handshake-continuation, not on ticket identity). Do not disable the krb5
replay cache (e.g. via KRB5RCACHETYPE=none) on a host running this
acceptor.

Lives outside ``services/xcep``/``services/wstep`` because one keytab/SPN
authenticates both protocols' Kerberos endpoints — they run on the same host
under the same identity, the same way a single machine's Kerberos identity
backs every SPN-registered service on it.

      back via ``WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate <token>`` on a ``401`` (still no
      body should be read) so the client can send the next leg on the *same*
      connection.
    - ``'authenticated'``: the exchange completed. ``client_principal`` names

    wrapping entirely, which is only true if you also control the client.
    A real ``Authorization: Negotiate`` header (RFC 4559) is *always* a
    SPNEGO-wrapped token, from any Windows client, unconditionally --
    confirmed against the lab: ``protocol='kerberos'`` builds a raw-Kerberos
    GSSAPI context that can't unwrap that envelope and fails with a
