"""
WS-Security XML-DSig verification for MS-WSTEP's Certificate-bound
renewal binding.

A real Windows CES client configured for Certificate authentication signs
the RST itself using its current certificate's private key (structure
confirmed via the MS-MDE2 RequestSecurityToken example in the Microsoft
Open Specifications): a ``wsse:Security`` header containing a
``wsse:BinarySecurityToken`` (the signing certificate) and a
``ds:Signature`` whose ``KeyInfo`` references that token.

This module verifies the *cryptographic* signature only — it proves the
sender possesses the private key matching the embedded certificate. It
does **not** decide whether that certificate should be trusted (chains to
a UCM-issued cert, not expired, not revoked); the caller
(``wstep_service.renew``) is responsible for that. Unlike EST's mTLS
renewal, where TLS already validated the presented cert's trust chain
before the app layer ever saw it, nothing here has validated trust yet —
signature verification alone only proves possession of a private key,
not that the matching certificate is one UCM should honor.

Crucially, a valid signature over *some* part of the document does not by
itself mean the CSR the caller is about to act on is that signed content
-- ``rst_parser.parse_rst`` locates the CSR ``BinarySecurityToken`` with
its own independent, position-based search of the document, which is not
guaranteed to land on the same element this module verified. Callers
must use ``SignedContent.covers()`` (returned alongside the cert) to
confirm the specific element they intend to trust was actually inside
the verified signature before relying on it -- see ``wstep_service.renew``.
